## For rsg_core framework (WIP)
Big thanks to Marwen-â˜­#0001 for helping with conversion and adding icons

## Script UI made by i3ucky:
https://github.com/i3ucky/bucky_mdt

## How to Install?

1. Make sure to rename to legends-mdt then ensure legends-mdt on your resources list. Also disable any other mdt script you are using.
2. Run the user_mdt SQL in your database.
3. Inside the config will be able to change the jobs required to use the mdt.
4. To bring up the mdt use /mdt in chat (this can be changed in config) and itll bring up the mdt with an animation as if you were pulling out a notebook or notepad.
